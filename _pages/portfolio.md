## Academic Activities 
### CERCIRAS Summer School (2022, Crotia) 
### HiPEAC Student Challenge - Fastest and The most energy efficient Histogram Equalization 

## Industrial Activities
### Internships
**1. Sundance Multiprocessor Long Term**
- _Task_: Development of Power Application for the VCS-1 using LynSyn Lite @ Sundance Multiprocessor Technology
- _Start/End_: 05.10.2021 / 10.10.2021  

**Internship Summary**: During my internship at [Sundance](https://store.sundance.com/), I was expected to measure runtime power dissipation and overall energy consumption of contemporary robotic applications that run on _Vision, Control and Sensor (VCS)_ single-board-computers with _Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale SoCs_. Sundance developed a power measurement tool, [_LynSyn Lite_](https://store.sundance.com/product/lynsyn-lite/), measuring both current and supply voltage. To measure the power consumption, I first targeted image processing and deep learning application domains and implemented histogram equalization and MLP algorithms through the _Vitis/Vivado_ environments. I tested my developments in AWS-2 instances provided by Sundance and embedded my application synthesis into the VCS board, which utilizes _petalinux_ as the OS. Afterward, I profiled the power consumption of those applications and reported the results to the company.
