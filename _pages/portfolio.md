### RAship in PARS Research Lab
- **Summary:** Actively worked on two projects during my RAship at [PARS](https://parsiyte.github.io/). The former one was about [fault tolerance and error propagation analysis](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=tr&user=Jber3GMAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=Jber3GMAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC) of GPGPU applications, while the latter one was about [resource-aware compiler design for approximate computing techniques](https://parsiyte.github.io/project/#:~:text=Grant%20%2D%202023/2025.-,RAPPROX,-%2D%20Resource%2DAware%20Compiler) in GPGPU applications. During my RAship there, I gained a comprehensive knowledge of GPU architectures, simulators, applications, and compilers. Our publications and my MSc thesis through these projects are mentioned in the publications section.

### HiPEAC Student Challenge - The most Efficient Histogram Equalization (2021)
**Summary:** I attended one of the [HiPEAC](https://www.hipeac.net/#/) [Student Challenges](https://www.hipeac.net/news/6964/hipeac-student-challenge-viii-histograms-in-the-making/) at Lyon in 2022, where we were expected to implement the fastest and the most energy-efficient histogram equalization algorithm. In this manner, my teammates and I implemented the histogram equalization algorithm on a _CPU_, _GPU_, and _Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+_, and demonstrated our results on performance and power consumption for those three platforms. We won the competition among other competitors with our results.

# Industrial Activities
## Job Experiences
### Software Engineer at VESTEL Electronics (Manisa, Turkey)
- _Task:_ Develop and maintain the interaction of internet services of TV software.
- _Start/End_: 05.10.2021 / 10.10.2021  

## Internships
### Sundance Multiprocessor (Chesham, UK) - Long-Term
- _Task_: Development of Power Profiling for Current Applications through VCS-1 and LynSyn Lite 
- _Start/End_: 08.10.2020 / 02.15.2021

**Internship Summary**: During my internship at [Sundance](https://store.sundance.com/), I was expected to measure runtime power dissipation and overall energy consumption of contemporary robotic applications that run on [_Vision, Control and Sensor (VCS)_](https://www.sundance.com/vcs-1/) single-board-computers with _Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale SoCs_. Sundance developed a power measurement tool, [_LynSyn Lite_](https://store.sundance.com/product/lynsyn-lite/), measuring both current and supply voltage. To measure the power consumption, I first targeted image processing and deep learning application domains and implemented histogram equalization and MLP algorithms through the _Vitis/Vivado_ environments. I tested my developments in AWS-2 instances provided by Sundance and embedded my application synthesis into the VCS board, which utilizes _petalinux_ as the OS. Afterward, I profiled the power consumption of those applications and reported the results to the company.
