## Academic Activities 
### CERCIRAS Summer School (2022 - Split, Crotia) 
Courses:
- [ ] _Time-predictable Multicore Architectures:_ Architecture introduction and time-predictability; T-CREST multicore processor; reconfigurable interconnectors, and MPI using Argo for NoCs.
- [ ] _Enery Consumption and Optimization Software:_ Measuring energy consumption through RAPL, and some tools on Python for statistical analysis.
- [ ] _Simulation and Behaviour Analysis of Complex Systems:_ Simulating IoT-Fog-Cloud systems; modelling, realizing and analyzing fog-assisted blockchain systems; and PriFoB: a Blockchain-based credential management service.
- [ ] _Understanding Mixed-Criticality Systems' Models and Implementation:_ Basics of real-time scheduling and response time analysis, Current innovations on mixed-criticality systems, concrete implementation with feather-weight instrumentation


- I have attended the CERCIRAS Training School funded by COST Action in 2022. The education details are shared [here](https://www.cerciras.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CERCIRAS-Summer-School-2022-Programmatic.pdf).



### HiPEAC Student Challenge - Fastest and The most energy efficient Histogram Equalization (2021)

## Industrial Activities
### Internships
**3. Sundance Multiprocessor (Chesham, UK) - Long-Term Internship**
- _Task_: Development of Power Profiling for Current Applications through VCS-1 and LynSyn Lite 
- _Start/End_: 05.10.2021 / 10.10.2021  

**Internship Summary**: During my internship at [Sundance](https://store.sundance.com/), I was expected to measure runtime power dissipation and overall energy consumption of contemporary robotic applications that run on [_Vision, Control and Sensor (VCS)_](https://www.sundance.com/vcs-1/) single-board-computers with _Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale SoCs_. Sundance developed a power measurement tool, [_LynSyn Lite_](https://store.sundance.com/product/lynsyn-lite/), measuring both current and supply voltage. To measure the power consumption, I first targeted image processing and deep learning application domains and implemented histogram equalization and MLP algorithms through the _Vitis/Vivado_ environments. I tested my developments in AWS-2 instances provided by Sundance and embedded my application synthesis into the VCS board, which utilizes _petalinux_ as the OS. Afterward, I profiled the power consumption of those applications and reported the results to the company.

**2. Roketsan (Defense Industry - Ankara, Turkey) - Internship**
- _Task_: Developing FAST and BRIEF algorithms through Xilinx Ultrascale SoCs 
- _Date_: 2019 Summer Term

**Internship Summary**: During my internship at [Roketsan](https://www.roketsan.com.tr/en), I was expected to implement _[FAST](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/df/d0c/tutorial_py_fast.html) (Features from Accelerated Segment Test)_ and _[BRIEF](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/d7d/tutorial_py_brief.html) (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features)_ algorithms onto Xilinx FPGAs to test how they can be used to guide missile systems. Since it's a defense industry, I wasn't allowed to share code developments but I reported the allowed information in the following report.

**1. Dalgakiran Compressor (Compressor Machinery Industry) - Internship**
- _Task_: Designing and integrating electrical panels, including multiple sensors and PLC, into the compressor machinery. 
- _Date_: 2019 Summer Term

**Internship Summary**: During my internship at [Dalgakiran](https://www.dalgakiran.com/en/), I was expected to design electrical boards for various compressor machines where electrical boards are equipped with multiple sensors and a PCB. Basically, PLC controls the machinery actuators through sensors and enables them to operate properly.
