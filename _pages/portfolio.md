# Academic Activities
### CERCIRAS Summer School (2022 - Split, Crotia) 
**Summary:** - I attended the [CERCIRAS Training School in 2022](https://www.cerciras.org/cerciras-training-school-2022/). The training school included dense and fast lessons, as listed below, given by many professors from DTU, the University of Padua, RUC, and the University of Szeged. 
> **_Time-predictable Multicore Architectures:_** Architecture introduction and time-predictability; T-CREST multicore processor; reconfigurable interconnectors, and MPI using Argo for NoCs. <br>
> **_Enery Consumption and Optimization Software:_** Measuring energy consumption through RAPL, and some tools on Python for statistical analysis. <br>
> **_Simulation and Behaviour Analysis of Complex Systems:_** Simulating IoT-Fog-Cloud systems; modelling, realizing and analyzing fog-assisted blockchain systems; and PriFoB: a Blockchain-based credential management service. <br>
> **_Understanding Mixed-Criticality Systems' Models and Implementation:_** Basics of real-time scheduling and response time analysis, Current innovations on mixed-criticality systems, concrete implementation with feather-weight instrumentation. <be>

### HiPEAC Student Challenge - The most Efficient Histogram Equalization (2021)
**Summary:** I attended one of the [HiPEAC](https://www.hipeac.net/#/) [Student Challenges](https://www.hipeac.net/news/6964/hipeac-student-challenge-viii-histograms-in-the-making/) at Lyon in 2022, where we were expected to implement the fastest and the most energy-efficient histogram equalization algorithm. In this manner, my teammates and I implemented the histogram equalization algorithm on a _CPU_, _GPU_, and _Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+_, and demonstrated our results on performance and power consumption for those three platforms. We won the competition among other competitors with our results.

### TAships

# Industrial Activities
## Job Experiences
### Software Engineer at VESTEL Electronics (Manisa, Turkey)
- _Task:_ Develop and maintain the interaction of internet services of TV software.
- _Start/End_: 05.10.2021 / 10.10.2021  

## Internships
### Sundance Multiprocessor (Chesham, UK) - Long-Term
- _Task_: Development of Power Profiling for Current Applications through VCS-1 and LynSyn Lite 
- _Start/End_: 08.10.2020 / 02.15.2021

**Internship Summary**: During my internship at [Sundance](https://store.sundance.com/), I was expected to measure runtime power dissipation and overall energy consumption of contemporary robotic applications that run on [_Vision, Control and Sensor (VCS)_](https://www.sundance.com/vcs-1/) single-board-computers with _Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale SoCs_. Sundance developed a power measurement tool, [_LynSyn Lite_](https://store.sundance.com/product/lynsyn-lite/), measuring both current and supply voltage. To measure the power consumption, I first targeted image processing and deep learning application domains and implemented histogram equalization and MLP algorithms through the _Vitis/Vivado_ environments. I tested my developments in AWS-2 instances provided by Sundance and embedded my application synthesis into the VCS board, which utilizes _petalinux_ as the OS. Afterward, I profiled the power consumption of those applications and reported the results to the company.

### Roketsan (Defense Industry - Ankara, Turkey)
- _Task_: Developing FAST and BRIEF algorithms through Xilinx Ultrascale SoCs 
- _Date_: 2019 Summer Term

**Internship Summary**: During my internship at [Roketsan](https://www.roketsan.com.tr/en), I was expected to implement _[FAST](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/df/d0c/tutorial_py_fast.html) (Features from Accelerated Segment Test)_ and _[BRIEF](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/d7d/tutorial_py_brief.html) (Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features)_ algorithms onto Xilinx FPGAs to test how they can be used to guide missile systems. Since it's a defense industry, I wasn't allowed to share code developments but I reported the allowed information in the following report.

### Dalgakiran Compressor (Compressor Machinery Industry - Istanbul, Turkey)
- _Task_: Designing and integrating electrical panels, including multiple sensors and PLC, into the compressor machinery. 
- _Date_: 2019 Summer Term

**Internship Summary**: During my internship at [Dalgakiran](https://www.dalgakiran.com/en/), I was expected to design electrical boards for various compressor machines where electrical boards are equipped with multiple sensors and a PCB. Basically, PLC controls the machinery actuators through sensors and enables them to operate properly.
