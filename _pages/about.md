I am Burak Topcu. I got my BSc degree from the Dept. of [Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Middle East Technical University]([url](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/)) as an honorary student in 2020. There, I took introductory and intermediate-level courses in Electronics (semiconductor devices, analog/digital circuits, and logic design), Electromagnetic Theory and Waves, Electromechanical Energy Conversions, Circuits, and Core Computer Science (Data structures, operating systems, and so on.) domains.

After graduating from there in 2020, I started my MSc degree at the Dept. of Computer Engineering at Izmir Institute of Technology with the supervision of Isil Oz. During my MSc, I first conducted fault tolerance analysis of GPU hardware and proposed an ML-based soft error vulnerability evaluation framework. Thanks to this study, I closely investigated GPU architectures and subsequently gained a deeper knowledge of performance and energy consumption. Afterward, I carried out approximation-based accelerating solutions on GPU hardware for applications that cannot utilize architecture well and reached significant performance and energy improvements. In the upcoming education term, I will start my PhD education at Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at PSU with the supervision of Taylan Kandemir.
