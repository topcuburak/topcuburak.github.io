Hello World! I am Burak Topcu. I am a second-year PhD student in the Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at PSU, under the supervision of [Mahmut Taylan Kandemir](https://www.cse.psu.edu/hpcl/kandemir/). I completed my course workload and passed the qualifying exams, which consisted of core concepts of computer science, including operating systems, computer architecture, algorithms, theory, and data structures. I am an active member of _AI4CI core group_, and my research focuses as listed below: 

**1. UVM Performance in Heterogenous Computing Environments:** <br /> 
**_1.1._** Analyzing performance tradeoffs between page migration and remote direct accesses in multi-GPU systems. <br /> 
**_1.2._** Mitigating the performance overhead of address translation impact in multi-GPU systems. <br /> 
**2. Sustainability in Computing Systems** <br /> 
**_2.1_.** Carbon footprint measurements in various scale computing infrastructures. <br /> 
**_2.2._** Research on the methodological approaches to mitigate carbon footprint on cloud infrastructures. <br /> 
**3. LLM Inference Accelerators**

### Short Biography
I pursued my BSc degree from the [Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/) at Middle East Technical University (METU) as an honorary student in 2020. There, I took introductory and intermediate-level courses, such as electronics (semiconductor devices, analog/digital circuits, and logic design), electromagnetic theory & waves, electromechanical energy conversions, circuits, signals and systems, and core computer science (data structures, operating systems, and so on.) domains. One can reach out to my graduation project [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pE_Y60KRJ9o), which was about visible light communication and serial communication protocols. 

Afterwards, I started my MSc education in the [Dept. of Computer Engineering](https://ceng.iyte.edu.tr/)  at Izmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH) under the supervision of [Isil Oz](https://ceng.iyte.edu.tr/people/isil-oz/), and worked as an RA in [PARS Laboratory](https://parsiyte.github.io/). I worked in Resource-Aware Compiler Design for Approximate Computing Techniques in GPGPU Applications ([RAPPROX](https://ceng.iyte.edu.tr/new-tubitak-project/), TUBITAK 2519) and Hardware Fault Tolerance Analysis for GPGPU Applications ([FTGPGPU](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=tr&user=Jber3GMAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=Jber3GMAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC), TUBITAK 3501) Projects. During my MSc, I gained a comprehensive knowledge of _fault tolerance and error vulnerability_, _performance and energy optimizations on GPUs_, and _approximation-based accelerations on GPUs_ subjects. In addition, I took advanced computer architecture, heterogeneous programming, deep learning, and computer network courses.
