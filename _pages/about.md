I am Burak Topcu. I got my BSc degree from the Dept. of [Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Middle East Technical University]([url](https://eee.metu.edu.tr/)) as an honorary student in 2020. There, I took introductory and intermediate-level courses in Electronics (semiconductor devices, analog/digital circuits, and logic design), Electromagnetic Theory and Waves, Electromechanical Energy Conversions, Circuits, Signals and Systems, and Core Computer Science (Data structures, operating systems, and so on.) domains.

After graduating there in 2020, I started my MSc at the [Dept. of Computer Engineering at Izmir Institute of Technology]([url](https://ceng.iyte.edu.tr/)) with the supervision of Isil Oz, working as a research assistant at [PARS Laboratory]([url](https://parsiyte.github.io/)). During my MSc education, I took advanced Computer Architecture (Multi-core and GPU architectures), Heterogenous Programming (CUDA, OpenMP), Deep Learning (DNNs, Encoding & Decoding), and Computer Network courses. Besides, I worked on the Resource-Aware Compiler Design for Approximate Computing Techniques in General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) Applications ([RAPPROX](url), TUBITAK 2519), and Hardware Fault Tolerance Analysis for General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) Applications ([FTGPGPU]([url](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=tr&user=Jber3GMAAAAJ&sortby=pubdate&citation_for_view=Jber3GMAAAAJ:QIV2ME_5wuYC)), TUBITAK 3501) Projects. 


. During my MSc, I first conducted fault tolerance analysis of GPU hardware and proposed an ML-based soft error vulnerability evaluation framework. Thanks to this study, I closely investigated GPU architectures and subsequently gained a deeper knowledge of performance and energy consumption. Afterward, I carried out approximation-based accelerating solutions on GPU hardware for applications that cannot utilize architecture well and reached significant performance and energy improvements. In the upcoming education term, I will start my PhD education at Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at PSU with the supervision of Taylan Kandemir.
