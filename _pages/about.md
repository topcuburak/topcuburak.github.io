I am Burak Top√ßu. I graduated from the Dept. of Electrical and Electronics Engineering at METU as an honor student in 2020. In the same year, I started my MSc education at the Dept. of Computer Engineering at IZTECH with the supervision of Isil Oz. During my MSc, I first conducted fault tolerance analysis of GPU hardware and proposed an ML-based soft error vulnerability evaluation framework. Thanks to this study, I closely investigated GPU architectures and subsequently gained a deeper knowledge of performance and energy consumption. Afterward, I carried out approximation-based accelerating solutions on GPU hardware for applications that cannot utilize architecture well and reached significant performance and energy improvements. In the upcoming years, I will start my PhD education at Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering at PSU with the supervision of Taylan Kandemir.
