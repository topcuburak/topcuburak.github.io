**Summary**: The internship facilities provided by HiPEAC organization are highly beneficial for the students in terms of being part of specialized companies such as ARM, Sundance, etc., on highly technical topics. I applied to Sundance's Beyond Tulipp internship program in May. We agreed on the proposal I submitted to the institution, and I completed some preliminary training offered by Xilinx. Thanks to this training duration, I learned the current Xilinx chips and unified code development environments. After I started the internship, I had the opportunity to test my knowledge resulting from the tutorials provided by Xilinx and the specifications supplied by Sundance. During the internship, they carried out weekly meetings to talk about the current process of company members and mine also. I can ask my questions directly to the Company members at any time via mail or Slack. This is a significant advantage for the interns in terms of increasing the intern's working motivation and pushing up the intern's knowledge about both coding and hardware. At the end of this internship, I can say that I gained experience with the Zynq US+ chips, Petalinux environment, and Xilinx ng platforms (both Vivado and Vitis HLS).
