I presented my results obtained from the internship duration in the HiPEAC Student Challenge event in Lyon. I am glad to attend this internship opportunity and grateful to both HiPEAC and Sundance for their interests and kind approaches. You can reach out to the results and presentations via the shared [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/topcuburak/Internship-Sundance/tree/main/Histogram_Equalization).
