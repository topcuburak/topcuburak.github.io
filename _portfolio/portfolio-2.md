We (me, Emre Dincer, and Ercument Kaya) presented the performance and energy consumption results at the HiPEAC Student Challenge event in Lyon. In this work, we tested the algorithm on CPU, GPU, and Zynq FPGA resources regarding execution time and energy dissipation for different pictures shared in GitHub. I am glad to attend this internship opportunity and grateful to both HiPEAC and Sundance for their interests and kind approaches. You can reach out to the results and presentations via the shared [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/topcuburak/Internship-Sundance/tree/main/Histogram_Equalization).
